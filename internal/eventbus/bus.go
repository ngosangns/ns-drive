// Package eventbus provides in-process typed event channels.
//
// Each Subscribe(topic, handler) gets its OWN buffered channel and goroutine,
// so Publish fans out (broadcasts) a copy of the event to every subscriber of
// the topic — not a single competing consumer. The returned cancel() stops
// that one subscription.
//
// Publish is non-blocking: if a subscriber's buffer is full it drops the
// OLDEST queued event to make room for the newest, so a slow subscriber never
// blocks the publisher and recent/terminal events are favoured over stale
// backlog.
//
// Close is concurrency-safe with Publish: it never closes the event channels
// publishers write to (it only signals reader goroutines to stop), so a
// concurrent Publish can never panic with "send on closed channel".
//
// Glob-free multi-topic subscription is supported via SubscribeAll, used by
// the SSE handler.
